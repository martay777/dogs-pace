    <h2>Welcome to Dogs Pace</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">At Dogs Pace, we understand that every dog has its own unique rhythm. Our dog walking services are carefully tailored to match your dog's individual pace, whether it’s a gentle stroll for an older companion or a supportive walk for a nervous friend. We proudly serve Guildford and the local surrounding areas, dedicated to ensuring every dog receives the care and attention they deserve.</p>
    
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Maddy! I've dedicated my life to caring for animals, with extensive experience in working with dogs, including those with reactive and nervous behaviours. My journey with animals is more than just a job—it's a lifelong passion.</p>
    
    <p>I am proud to hold an Animal Management Level 3 National Extended Diploma and to be a certified instructor in Hoopers, a recognised dog sport that fosters agility and teamwork. Additionally, I’m a trained dog first aider and an approved handler by Mary Foryszewski at Pawfect Training School.</p>
    
    <p>At Dogs Pace, your pet's safety and happiness are our top priorities. Our services are fully insured, and our van is fitted with secure, comfortable crates and a fan for your pet's comfort. We also use GPS trackers to give you peace of mind, knowing your pets are always safe on every walk.</p>

    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Before any services are provided, we conduct an introductory assessment to understand your dog’s needs and personality.</p>

    <h3>Group Walks - £16.50*</h3>
    <p>Our group walks are designed to be enjoyable and stress-free for all participants. We carefully select groups based on compatibility, ensuring that every dog is happy, safe, and socialising positively. To maintain quality and safety, we limit our group sizes to a maximum of 5 dogs per handler.</p>

    <h3>Private Walks - £30*</h3>
    <p>For dogs who prefer one-on-one attention or aren't ready for group settings, we offer personalised private walks. These walks are tailored to your dog's specific needs and preferences, allowing us to form a close bond with your pet.</p>

    <p class="note">*Additional dogs from the same household can join the walk for just £10 per dog.</p>
